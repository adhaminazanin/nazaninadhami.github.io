                <p>I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida majoring in Curriculum and Instruction with a specialization in Educational Technology, and I expect to graduate in Summer 2027. My research and coursework focus on how emerging technologies, such as AI, can enhance teaching and learning experiences. Through EME 6208: Designing Integrated Media Environments, I learned to design and develop interactive multimedia learning tools using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These experiences have strengthened my abilities in instructional design, user experience, and digital content development. I am particularly passionate about designing inclusive, data-informed learning technologies that empower diverse learners and support equitable access to high-quality education. </p>

					<h2>Image Editing</h2>
					<p>For my design project, I created both a book cover and a logo that reflect my focus on education, innovation, and career growth. For the book cover titled Empower the Future Workforce, I highlight skill development and future learning. For the logo, I designed “EmpowerLearn” to represent collaboration, empowerment, and the role of technology in shaping education.

					<h2>Web Design</h2>
					<p>For my web design projects, I created an interactive EdTech Quiz and a Drag-and-Drop assessment tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz featured dynamic feedback and clean visual styling, while the drag-and-drop activity allowed users to match items to correct categories in real time. These projects strengthened my skills in front-end development, user interaction design, and educational interface creation.</p>

					<h2>Video Production</h2>
					<p>This educational video introduces SmartFlash, an AI-powered adaptive flashcard platform that personalizes learning for every user. The video walks you through how to use SmartFlash and how it identifies knowledge gaps through quick assessments, generates customized flashcards from your study materials, and enhances engagement through progress tracking and interactive learning games.

					<h2>Digital Animation</h2>
					<p>This short educational animation explains how energy moves through an energy system using simple visuals and smooth motion effects. The animation shows key components like the wind turbine, energy flow arrows, clouds, and system icons.Each components animated through motion tweens, rotations, and carefully timed movements to illustrate processes clearly. Created in Adobe Animate with vector graphics and symbol-based animation, the project also includes voice narration added through Clipchamp to guide viewers through the scene. The animation is designed to make a complex system more intuitive and visually engaging for learners.</p>

					<h2>Screencasting</h2>
					<p>This instructional screencast provides an in-depth walkthrough of SmartFlash, the adaptive flashcard platform our team developed to support personalized and efficient learning. In this video, I show how to navigate the interface step-by-step, beginning with logging in and exploring the dashboard, then moving into how to create customized flashcards, organize study sets, and switch between different learning modes. The screencast also highlights SmartFlash’s interactive features—such as real-time progress tracking, automated feedback, and adaptive review cycles—showing how each tool works together to enhance the overall learning experience.</p>

					<h2>E-Portfolio</h2>
					<p>This e-portfolio is a reflection of my web design skills developed throughout the course. It showcases the projects I created, including an interactive EdTech Quiz, a Drag-and-Drop assessment, and a professional portfolio website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects demonstrate my ability to design engaging, user-friendly learning environments that combine creativity with functionality.
