        <h2> EdTech Quiz</h2>
        <p>
          Creating my interactive EdTech quiz was a meaningful experience that helped me better understand how simple web technologies can be used to support engaging learning experiences. Although the quiz itself is straightforward, the process of designing it pushed me to think deeply about how learners interact with online assessments and how small design decisions can influence clarity, motivation, and overall usability. One of the most important takeaways was seeing how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can work together to create immediate, responsive feedback that feels both instructional and playful. With just a few lines of JavaScript, I was able to create a system where users receive instant confirmation of their choices, reinforcing correct answers and helping them learn from mistakes in real time. This helped me appreciate how interactivity can transform a static page into a more meaningful learning tool.

Another key part of the reflection involves the connection between design and learning. Adjusting visual elements such as spacing, labeling, and tone showed me how even small interface changes can make the experience more inviting and reduce cognitive load for learners. 

Publishing the quiz online also expanded my understanding of digital environments. Deploying my quiz on a custom domain gave me hands-on experience in managing repositories, publishing through GitHub Pages, and configuring domain settings—skills that are increasingly important for educational technologists. Seeing the quiz live on my own website made the project feel more real and underscored the value of creating tools that are accessible beyond the classroom.

        <h2> Drag-and-Drop Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          Designing the drag-and-drop matching activity was a nice opportunity to think about how interaction and visual design can support deeper learning. In this project, I moved beyond simple multiple-choice questions and created an activity where learners match different educational technology tools to their primary purposes. This required me to think carefully about how to structure categories, choose meaningful tools, and design the interface so that the task felt intuitive rather than overwhelming.

One of the most important aspects of this project was designing the categories themselves—communication tools, content creation tools, learning management systems, and assessment tools. I wanted the activity to do more than check recall; it needed to help learners mentally organize tools based on how and why they are used. This categorization element turns the interaction into a small conceptual map of the EdTech landscape.

From a design perspective, working with drag-and-drop mechanics showed how important layout and visual hierarchy are for usability. I focused on making the four destination areas clearly labeled, balanced in size, and visually consistent, so learners could easily scan, compare, and make decisions. The feedback system, which highlights correct and incorrect placements, supports formative learning by giving learners an immediate sense of their understanding without feeling punitive. This kind of gentle feedback encourages exploration and correction.

I also realized how much visual style shapes the learning experience. Color choices, spacing, and consistent card sizes helped make the activity feel more polished and professional, which I believe can increase learner engagement and perceived value. Overall, this project deepened my appreciation for interactive learning design and showed me how relatively simple drag-and-drop interactions can foster categorization, reflection, and active processing of educational technology concepts.
