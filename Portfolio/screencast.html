      <h2>Exploring SmartFlash: A Guided Screencast</h2>
      <p>
        Creating my screencast on how to use SmartFlash was an interesting learning experience that helped me understand both the technical and pedagogical aspects of producing clear instructional videos. For this assignment, I selected SmartFlash which is an adaptive flashcard platform that our team designed as my demonstration topic because its interface is intuitive, yet it contains multiple features that require guided explanation. I began by identifying a task that could be demonstrated within the required 2–4 minute window, showing users how to navigate SmartFlash, create flashcards, and access the main learning tools. After choosing the topic, I outlined the sequence of steps I would cover in the video, ensuring the order was logical and easy to follow. This outline later served as the foundation for my script, which I wrote carefully to maintain clarity, accuracy, and proper English grammar. I tried to capture smooth screen movements and incorporate helpful features such as zooming, mouse highlighting, and panning. These effects were especially useful when demonstrating smaller interface elements, such as buttons and menu options, making the instructions clearer for viewers. Throughout the recording process, I paid close attention to timing so that each step was demonstrated at a comfortable pace without exceeding the 4-minute limit. I rerecorded several sections to eliminate errors, pauses, or unclear narration, and made sure the final product met the assignment’s expectations for quality and fluency. Once the recording was complete, I exported the project as an MP4 file and uploaded it to YouTube for easy sharing and embedding. This project strengthened my skills in planning, scripting, recording, and editing instructional content. It also increased my confidence in creating professional, user-friendly screencasts that can effectively guide learners through digital tools.

      <h2>AI-Generated Video Project</h2>
      <p>
        Completing this video project was a meaningful learning experience. Using Clipchamp’s AI-video tools simplified much of the production, rom automatically organizing media and composing a video, to selecting music and formatting for the final export, which allowed me to focus more on the core message rather than getting bogged down in technical editing details. 
At the same time, the process reinforced the importance of thoughtful preparation. Before pressing “generate,” I needed to have a clear purpose and structure for the video, which guided the AI’s outputs and prevented the result from feeling generic. In retrospect, writing a strong script or outline even when using AI helped for a meaningful narration and made the final video more coherent and meaningful. 
Reflecting on where things went well, the video felt polished, consistent, and relatively professional with minimal effort, and where I could improve next time: perhaps refining prompts more carefully, adding manual tweaks (overlays, pacing, emphasis) after AI compose, or layering in more personalized voiceover or commentary rather than relying entirely on generic AI outputs.
