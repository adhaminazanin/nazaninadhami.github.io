      <h2>Energy Flow Animation</h2>
      <p>
        Creating this short animation in Adobe Animate was a very meaningful learning experience for me. I started by setting up an HTML5 Canvas project with the size 900 by 500. Then I imported several vector images that showed different parts of the energy system. Before animating anything, I arranged the objects on the stage, changed some colors, and added the title text. I also added some decorative clouds and adjusted their size to make the scene look more complete. A very important step was converting every moving object into a symbol. I learned that only symbols can be animated with motion tweens, and placing each symbol on its own layer helped me keep the timeline organized and easy to manage. I began animating the clouds. After converting them into symbols, I opened their individual layers, created a motion tween, and set the clouds to start outside the frame and move across the stage. I also changed the duration from one second to six seconds so the movement would look slow and natural. Next, I worked on the spinning wind turbine. Instead of rotating it manually, I used the Clockwise rotation option in the Properties panel. This created a smooth, continuous spinning effect. I used a similar approach for the circular icons. For the arrows that show energy flow, I manually drew the path instead of using rotation, because it matched the meaning better. During the process, I watched a YouTube tutorial, which helped me understand new tools and techniques. After finishing my animation in Adobe Animate, I used Clipchamp to add voice narration with the text-to-speech feature. This made the animation clearer and easier to follow. Overall, this project helped me improve my animation skills and made me more confident in using Adobe Animate for educational and visual storytelling purposes.
